## Overview

Claude Code Workflow Optimizer is a comprehensive system that integrates seamlessly with Claude Code to provide automated, test-driven code optimization workflows. It analyzes your codebase for quality, architecture, security, and performance issues, then guides you through a structured decision process to implement improvements safely.

### Key Features

üîç **Automated Code Analysis** - Deep analysis of code changes across multiple dimensions  
üß™ **Test-First Approach** - TDD-driven optimization ensures no regressions  
üìã **Structured Decision Making** - Review and prioritize optimization opportunities  
üêô **GitHub Integration** - Create issues directly from optimization sessions  
üìä **Progress Tracking** - Comprehensive history and status monitoring  
üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Operations** - Isolated file structure preserves existing configurations

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and configured
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (optional, for GitHub integration)
- Git repository with existing codebase
- Test suite (recommended for test-driven optimization)

### Installation

**Note:** As an alpha release, installation requires manual setup. We're working toward simpler installation methods in future versions.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sebafm/claude-code-workflow-optimizer.git
   cd claude-code-workflow-optimizer
   ```

2. **Copy commands to your Claude Code commands directory:**
   ```bash
   cp commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
   ```

3. **Copy the enhanced project-scribe agent:**
   ```bash
   cp agents/project-scribe.md ~/.claude/agents/
   ```

4. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   claude-code /optimize-status
   ```

For detailed system documentation, troubleshooting, and advanced usage, see [OPTIMIZE_SYSTEM.md](OPTIMIZE_SYSTEM.md).

### Basic Usage

The optimizer follows a simple 4-step workflow:

```bash
# 1. Analyze your code changes
/optimize

# 2. Review and make decisions
/optimize-review
# Input: "Implement #1, #3, gh-issue #2, Skip #4"

# 3. Execute improvements
bash .claude/optimize/pending/commands.sh

# 4. Check system status
/optimize-status
```

## Core Commands

### `/optimize` - Analysis Phase
Analyzes recent code changes and generates structured optimization recommendations across:
- **Code Quality** - Performance, maintainability, patterns
- **Architecture** - Design alignment, API consistency
- **Security** - Vulnerabilities, best practices
- **Testing** - Coverage gaps, test impact analysis

### `/optimize-review` - Decision Phase
Interactive decision-making with flexible command syntax:

**Individual Decisions:**
```bash
"Implement #1, #3, #8"                    # Immediate implementation
"Defer #2, #4 --comment='After v2.0'"    # Backlog for later
"gh-issue #5, #7 --comment='Sprint planning'" # Create GitHub issues
"Skip #6, #10"                            # Permanently dismiss
```

**Batch Operations:**
```bash
"Implement all critical"      # Priority-based batch operations
"gh-issue all high"          # Create issues for all high-priority items
"Skip all low"               # Dismiss all low-priority issues
"Defer all"                  # Move everything to backlog
```

### `/optimize-status` - Monitoring
Real-time dashboard showing:
- Pending issues awaiting review
- Backlogged items for future sessions
- Completed optimizations history
- Recent activity and next steps

### `/optimize-gh-migrate` - GitHub Integration
Convert backlogged issues to GitHub issues for project management:
```bash
"Convert all"                # Migrate entire backlog
"Convert #2, #4"            # Specific issues
"Convert all high"          # Priority-based conversion
```

## Test-Driven Approach

The optimizer follows a rigorous test-first methodology:

1. **Test Impact Analysis** - Identifies which tests will be affected by proposed changes
2. **Test Updates** - Updates or creates tests before implementation
3. **Guided Implementation** - Subagents implement changes with test safety guards
4. **Validation Gates** - All changes must pass tests before documentation
5. **Rollback on Failure** - Automatic rollback if tests fail

This ensures **zero regressions** and maintains code quality throughout optimization.

## File Structure

The system creates an isolated directory structure that preserves your existing Claude Code configuration:

```
.claude/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ agents/           # Your existing agents (preserved)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/         # Your existing commands (preserved)  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ optimize/         # Optimization System (isolated)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pending/      # Current session data
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backlog/      # Deferred issues
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ completed/    # Implementation history
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ decisions/    # Decision tracking
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reports/      # Detailed analysis reports
```

## Integration with Subagents

The system leverages specialized Claude Code subagents for comprehensive analysis and implementation. The current release includes optimized versions of these general-purpose agents:

### **Included Agents**
- **`@code-reviewer`** - Code quality, performance, and maintainability analysis
- **`@database-architect`** - Database optimization and data access patterns
- **`@security-auditor`** - Security vulnerability assessment and best practices
- **`@test-automation-engineer`** - Test impact analysis and automated test updates
- **`@project-scribe`** - Enhanced documentation and change tracking with optimization integration
- **`@task-decomposer`** - Complex task breakdown and structured implementation planning

### **Agent Configuration**
The system automatically detects available agents and can be customized via configuration:

```json
// ~/.claude/optimize/config/active-agents.json
{
  "analysis_agents": [
    "code-reviewer",
    "database-architect", 
    "security-auditor",
    "test-automation-engineer"
  ],
  "implementation_agents": [
    "task-decomposer",
    "project-scribe"
  ],
  "custom_agents": [
    "your-custom-performance-agent"
  ]
}
```

**Analysis Phase:** Configured analysis agents examine code changes from their specialized perspectives
**Implementation Phase:** Task decomposition and guided implementation with automatic documentation

### **Extensibility**
- **Custom Agents**: Add your own domain-specific agents to the configuration
- **Agent Discovery**: System automatically detects new agents matching the expected interface
- **Selective Usage**: Enable/disable agents based on project needs and optimization focus

## Advanced Features

### GitHub Integration
- **Issue Creation** - Structured GitHub issues with optimization context
- **Label Management** - Automatic labeling by priority and category
- **Backlog Migration** - Convert deferred items to project management issues
- **Tracking Integration** - Links optimization sessions to GitHub activity

### Decision Tracking
- **Historical Record** - Complete audit trail of all optimization decisions
- **Comment System** - Rich context for why decisions were made
- **Progress Metrics** - Quantitative tracking of optimization impact
- **Team Coordination** - Shareable reports for team alignment

### Safety Features
- **Isolated Structure** - No interference with existing Claude Code setup
- **Safe Cleanup** - `rm -rf .claude/optimize/` without affecting agents/commands
- **Test Validation** - Mandatory test passage before changes are documented
- **Rollback Support** - Easy recovery from problematic optimizations

## Examples

### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# After implementing a feature
git commit -m "feat: user authentication system"

# Run optimization analysis
/optimize
# ‚Üí Finds 6 issues: 2 security, 2 performance, 1 architecture, 1 testing

# Strategic decision making
/optimize-review
# ‚Üí "Implement #1, #4 (critical security), gh-issue #2, #3 (for next sprint), Defer #5, #6"

# Execute with confidence
bash .claude/optimize/pending/commands.sh
# ‚Üí Tests updated ‚Üí Changes implemented ‚Üí Tests pass ‚Üí Documentation updated
```

### Sprint Planning Integration
```bash
# Convert optimization findings to sprint items
/optimize-review
# ‚Üí "gh-issue all high --comment='Sprint 2024-Q1'"

# Result: Structured GitHub issues ready for sprint planning
```

### Quarterly Cleanup
```bash
# Review accumulated backlog
/optimize-status
# ‚Üí Shows 15 deferred issues from past sessions

# Convert to GitHub for project management
/optimize-gh-migrate
# ‚Üí "Convert all --comment='Q1 tech debt cleanup'"
```
