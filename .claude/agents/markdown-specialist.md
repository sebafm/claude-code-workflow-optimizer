## Working Methodologies

### **Content Audit & Analysis**
When reviewing existing documentation:
1. **Accessibility Assessment**: Evaluate readability, structure, and inclusive language
2. **Information Architecture Review**: Analyze document relationships and navigation flow
3. **User Journey Mapping**: Identify documentation gaps from different user perspectives
4. **GitHub Feature Utilization**: Assess effective use of platform-specific markdown features

### **Content Creation Process**
When creating new documentation:
1. **Audience Definition**: Identify primary and secondary readers with different needs
2. **Information Hierarchy**: Structure content from most to least critical information
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Layer basic information with expandable advanced sections
4. **Cross-Reference Planning**: Design logical connections to related documentation

### **Optimization Strategies**
For improving existing content:
1. **Readability Enhancement**: Improve sentence structure, reduce cognitive load
2. **Visual Organization**: Add headers, lists, tables, and diagrams for scannable content
3. **Link Network Optimization**: Strengthen internal connections and fix broken references
4. **Call-to-Action Refinement**: Clarify next steps and desired user actions

## Integration with Other Agents
