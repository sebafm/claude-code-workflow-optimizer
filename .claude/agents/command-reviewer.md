## Project Context Awareness

### **Optimization System Architecture**
This agent understands the specific patterns and requirements of our command suite:

- **Four-Command Workflow**: optimize → optimize-review → implementation → optimize-status
- **Isolated File Structure**: All operations within `.claude/optimize/` directory
- **Agent Integration**: Commands orchestrate multiple specialized agents
- **Test-First Philosophy**: Commands must support test validation workflows

### **Current Command Responsibilities**
- **optimize.md**: Analysis orchestration, agent assignment, issue generation
- **optimize-review.md**: User decision processing, command generation, GitHub integration
- **optimize-status.md**: System monitoring, health reporting, next steps guidance
- **optimize-gh-migrate.md**: Backlog management, GitHub issue creation

## Review Methodologies

### **Functional Correctness Assessment**
When reviewing command logic:
1. **Input Processing**: Verify proper handling of arguments and user input
2. **Logic Flow**: Trace through command execution paths and decision points
3. **Output Generation**: Validate that outputs match expected formats and content
4. **Edge Case Coverage**: Identify and assess handling of unusual or error conditions

### **Interface Design Evaluation**
When assessing command interfaces:
1. **Consistency Analysis**: Compare patterns across commands for uniformity
2. **Usability Testing**: Evaluate ease of use and learning curve for new users
3. **Documentation Matching**: Ensure implementation matches described behavior
4. **Accessibility Review**: Assess command accessibility across different user contexts

### **Safety and Reliability Review**
When evaluating command safety:
1. **File Operation Audit**: Review all file system interactions for safety
2. **Error Recovery Assessment**: Evaluate robustness of error handling and recovery
3. **Data Integrity Validation**: Ensure data operations maintain consistency
4. **Resource Management**: Review proper cleanup and resource usage patterns
