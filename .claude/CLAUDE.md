## üö® CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING: .claude/optimize/ Directory Protection

**‚ö†Ô∏è DIRECTORY PRESERVATION ALERT ‚ö†Ô∏è**

The `.claude/optimize/` directory contains **IRREPLACEABLE** user optimization session data and MUST be preserved at all costs:

### üõ°Ô∏è NEVER DELETE THESE DIRECTORIES:
- `.claude/optimize/` - **Contains all optimization session history**
- `.claude/optimize/decisions/` - **User decision records and audit trails**
- `.claude/optimize/completed/` - **Completed optimization tracking**
- `.claude/optimize/agents/` - **Dynamic agent assignments and configurations**

### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN OPERATIONS:
```bash
# NEVER run these commands - they will cause DATA LOSS:
rm -rf .claude/optimize/          # DESTROYS all optimization history
rm -rf .claude/optimize/*         # DESTROYS all session data
rmdir .claude/optimize/           # REMOVES optimization infrastructure
find .claude/optimize/ -delete    # DELETES all optimization files
```

### ‚úÖ SAFE FILE OPERATIONS ONLY:
```bash
# Safe: Create individual files
echo "content" > .claude/optimize/decisions/review_$(date +%s).md

# Safe: Modify existing files
echo "update" >> .claude/optimize/backlog.json

# Safe: Create directories if missing
mkdir -p .claude/optimize/decisions/
mkdir -p .claude/optimize/completed/

# Safe: Remove specific files (with confirmation)
[ -f .claude/optimize/temp.json ] && rm .claude/optimize/temp.json
```

### üìã MANDATORY SAFETY CHECKLIST:

Before ANY operation involving `.claude/optimize/`:

1. **‚úì Verify backup exists**: Check that protective backup was created (`tar -tzf`)
2. **‚úì Use atomic operations**: Write to temp files, then move into place
3. **‚úì Test commands first**: Use `--dry-run` or `echo` to preview operations
4. **‚úì Individual file operations**: Never use wildcards or recursive delete
5. **‚úì Check directory existence**: Always verify paths before operations

### üîß ATOMIC OPERATION PATTERNS:

```bash
# Correct: Atomic file creation
temp_file=$(mktemp)
echo "session data" > "$temp_file"
mv "$temp_file" .claude/optimize/decisions/session_123.md

# Correct: Safe file update
if [ -f .claude/optimize/backlog.json ]; then
    jq '.issues += [new_issue]' .claude/optimize/backlog.json > temp.json
    mv temp.json .claude/optimize/backlog.json
fi

# Correct: Directory structure creation
for dir in decisions completed agents; do
    mkdir -p ".claude/optimize/$dir"
done
```

### üóÇÔ∏è DATA RECOVERY REFERENCE:

If deletion occurs despite these warnings:
1. **Immediate**: Stop all optimization commands
2. **Backup**: Use the protective backup command from commit-changes.md
3. **Restore**: Extract session data from git history if available
4. **Report**: Document the incident for system improvement

### üéØ INTEGRATION WITH GIT:

The `.claude/optimize/` directory is **intentionally excluded** from git tracking:
- **Why**: Contains user-specific session data that shouldn't be shared
- **Effect**: Each user maintains their own optimization history
- **Backup**: Use the protective tar.gz backup system instead of git

**Remember**: Once deleted, optimization session history is **PERMANENTLY LOST** and cannot be recovered from git. The backup systems are the ONLY recovery mechanism.

## Core Concepts

### Optimization Workflow
1. **Analysis** (`/optimize`) - Scan code changes using multiple specialized agents
2. **Review** (`/optimize-review`) - User makes decisions on findings with flexible commands
3. **Implementation** - Test-first execution of selected improvements
4. **Monitoring** (`/optimize-status`) - Track progress and system health

### Test-First Philosophy
- All optimizations must pass existing tests before documentation
- Test impact analysis precedes any refactoring
- Automatic rollback on test failures
- Safety gates prevent broken code from being committed

### Agent Integration Strategy
- **v0.1.0 Current:** Hardcoded agent assignments with graceful degradation
- **v0.2.0 Planned:** Dynamic agent discovery and capability mapping
- **Philosophy:** Work with existing user agents, recommend additions when gaps detected

## Key Files & Their Purpose

### Commands (`/commands/`)
- **optimize.md**: Orchestrates analysis agents to examine code changes
- **optimize-review.md**: Processes user decisions and generates implementation commands
- **optimize-status.md**: Shows system state and suggests next actions
- **optimize-gh-migrate.md**: Converts deferred issues to GitHub issues

### Documentation
- **README.md**: User-facing documentation, installation, basic usage
- **ROADMAP.md**: Development timeline and feature planning (flexible, not date-bound)
- **CHANGELOG.md**: Complete record of all changes and optimization sessions
- **docs/OPTIMIZE_SYSTEM.md**: Complete technical documentation and troubleshooting
- **docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md**: Comprehensive requirements, metrics, and strategic documentation

## Development Principles

### Alpha Project Approach
- **Honest Communication**: Clear about current limitations and future plans
- **User Feedback Driven**: Features prioritized based on real usage patterns
- **Iterative Development**: Small, stable improvements over large changes
- **Community-First**: Welcoming to new contributors and feedback

### Code Quality Standards
- **Markdown-First Documentation**: All guidance in readable .md files
- **No Hardcoded Assumptions**: System adapts to different environments
- **Graceful Degradation**: Missing components don't break core functionality
- **Clear Error Messages**: Users understand what went wrong and how to fix it

## Working with This Project

### When Adding Features
1. **Update ROADMAP.md** if adding new major features
2. **Test with missing agents** - ensure graceful degradation works
3. **Update docs/OPTIMIZE_SYSTEM.md** with new functionality
4. **Consider backwards compatibility** for existing users

### When Modifying Commands
1. **Test hardcoded agent assignments** work with common agent setups
2. **Ensure clean bash syntax** - no `#` comments inside code blocks  
3. **Update examples** in README.md if command interface changes
4. **Verify cross-platform compatibility** (tested on Windows via bash emulation)

### When Writing Documentation
- **Be honest about Alpha status** - set realistic expectations
- **Include practical examples** - real workflow scenarios
- **Link documents together** - create clear navigation paths
- **Test all code examples** - ensure they actually work

## Important Constraints & Preferences

### File Naming & Organization
- All commands use `.md` extension with YAML frontmatter
- Use descriptive names: `optimize-review.md` not `review.md`
- Technical documentation goes in `/docs/` directory
- Agents are located in `.claude/agents/` directory
- Keep related functionality grouped logically

### Code Style in Commands
- **No bash comments (`#`) inside code blocks** - they render as markdown headers
- Use descriptive echo statements instead of comments for clarity  
- Prefer `mkdir -p` over complex conditional directory creation
- Always handle missing files/commands gracefully
- **MANDATORY: Use atomic operations** for all `.claude/optimize/` file modifications
- **FORBIDDEN: Directory deletion commands** - especially `rm -rf .claude/optimize/`
- **REQUIRED: Individual file operations** - never use wildcards in delete operations
- **SAFETY FIRST: Test destructive commands** with `--dry-run` or `echo` before execution

### User Experience Priorities
1. **Immediate Value**: System works out-of-box with minimal setup
2. **Clear Feedback**: Users always know what's happening and what's next
3. **Safe Operations**: Never delete user data without explicit confirmation  
4. **Honest Limitations**: Upfront about what doesn't work yet

## Development Context

### Target Users
- **Primary**: Claude Code users seeking structured code optimization
- **Secondary**: Teams wanting systematic code quality processes
- **Technical Level**: Comfortable with command-line tools, basic git knowledge

### Technology Choices
- **Bash Commands**: Cross-platform compatibility via Claude Code environment
- **Markdown Documentation**: Human-readable, git-friendly, widely supported
- **JSON Data Files**: Simple structured data for issue tracking
- **GitHub CLI Integration**: Leverages existing developer workflows

### Enhanced System Implementation (September 2025) - COMPLETE 6-COMMAND WORKFLOW

## Commands for Common Tasks

When working on this project, you'll frequently need these commands:

```bash
# Test command syntax (no execution)
claude --dry-run /optimize

# Validate markdown structure  
markdownlint *.md commands/*.md

# Check for broken internal links
find . -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "docs/OPTIMIZE_SYSTEM.md" {} \;
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Verification Commands

**ALWAYS run these before ANY .claude/optimize/ operations:**

```bash
# Verify optimize directory structure exists and is protected
ls -la .claude/optimize/ 2>/dev/null || echo "Directory missing - safe to create"

# Check for existing optimization session data
find .claude/optimize/ -name "*.json" -o -name "*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l

# Verify backup protection exists (should show tar.gz files)
ls -la .claude/*backup*.tar.gz 2>/dev/null || echo "No backups found - create backup first"

# Test atomic operation pattern (safe preview)
echo "mkdir -p .claude/optimize/decisions/" && echo "echo 'test' > /tmp/test.tmp && mv /tmp/test.tmp .claude/optimize/test.json"

# Verify git ignore is protecting optimize directory
git check-ignore .claude/optimize/test.json && echo "‚úÖ Protected by .gitignore" || echo "‚ùå WARNING: Not protected by .gitignore"
```

### üö® Emergency Data Protection Commands

**If you suspect .claude/optimize/ might be at risk:**

```bash
# Create immediate protective backup
tar -czf ".claude/optimize-emergency-backup-$(date +%s).tar.gz" .claude/optimize/ 2>/dev/null

# Verify backup was created successfully
ls -la .claude/optimize-emergency-backup-*.tar.gz | tail -1

# Test backup integrity
tar -tzf .claude/optimize-emergency-backup-*.tar.gz | head -5
```

## Notes for Claude Code

- This is an **early-stage open source project** - be encouraging and constructive
- **Test safety** is paramount - never suggest changes that could break user's workflow  
- **üö® DATA PROTECTION PRIORITY**: Never suggest operations that could delete `.claude/optimize/`
- **ATOMIC OPERATIONS REQUIRED**: All file modifications in `.claude/optimize/` must use temp-file-then-move pattern
- **BACKUP VERIFICATION**: Always confirm protective backups exist before optimization operations
- When updating commands, **preserve backward compatibility** where possible
- **Ask clarifying questions** if requirements seem to conflict with Alpha constraints
- **Suggest gradual improvements** rather than major architectural changes
- Always consider **user experience impact** of any modifications suggested
- **INCIDENT AWARENESS**: This project has recovered from a complete `.claude/optimize/` deletion incident - prevention is critical
