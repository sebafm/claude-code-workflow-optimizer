**Dependencies:** Community feedback on v0.1.0, agent compatibility testing  

### Core Features
- [ ] **Agent Auto-Discovery** - Automatically detect and catalog existing user agents
- [ ] **Capability Detection** - Analyze what each agent can do based on their descriptions
- [ ] **Compatibility Assessment** - Determine which agents work well with optimization workflows
- [ ] **Gap Analysis** - Identify missing capabilities for comprehensive optimization

### Intelligent Agent Recommendations
- [ ] **Project Type Detection** - Analyze codebase to determine project characteristics (web app, API, data pipeline, etc.)
- [ ] **Missing Agent Suggestions** - Recommend specific agents based on detected gaps
- [ ] **Agent Marketplace Integration** - Connect to community agent repositories
