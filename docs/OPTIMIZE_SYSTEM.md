## Commands Overview

### `/optimize` - Analysis Phase
**Purpose:** Analyze code changes for quality, architecture, and security issues
**Output:** 
- `.claude/optimize/pending/issues.json` (structured issues)
- `.claude/optimize/reports/optimization_DATE.md` (detailed report)
**Status:** "WAITING FOR REVIEW"

### `/optimize-review` - Decision Phase  
**Purpose:** Process user decisions and generate implementation commands
**Input Examples:** 
- Individual: `"Implement #1, #3, gh-issue #5, Skip #2, Defer #4"`
- Batch: `"Skip all"`, `"Implement all"`, `"gh-issue all"`, `"Defer all"`
- Mixed: `"Implement all critical, gh-issue all high, Defer the rest"`
**Output:**
- `.claude/optimize/pending/commands.sh` (subagent commands for implemented issues)
- GitHub issues created via gh CLI (for gh-issue selections)
- `.claude/optimize/backlog/deferred_issues.json` (deferred issues)
- `.claude/optimize/completed/skipped_issues.json` (permanently dismissed issues)
- `.claude/optimize/decisions/review_DATE.md` (decision tracking)
**Status:** "READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION"

### `/optimize-status` - Monitoring
**Purpose:** System overview and health monitoring
**Output:** Real-time status of pending, backlog, and completed issues

### `/optimize-gh-migrate` - GitHub Migration
**Purpose:** Convert deferred issues from backlog to GitHub issues
**Input Examples:**
- Individual: `"Convert #2, #4"`
- Batch: `"Convert all"`, `"Convert all high"`
**Output:** GitHub issues created, backlog cleared, migration tracking
**Status:** "BACKLOG MIGRATED TO GITHUB"

```

### Integration with Subagents

### Analysis Subagents (used by `/optimize`)
- **@code-reviewer**: Code quality, performance, maintainability analysis
- **@database-architect**: Data access patterns and database optimization
- **@python-backend-architect**: Backend architecture and API alignment
- **@security-auditor**: Security vulnerabilities and best practices
- **@test-automation-engineer**: Test coverage analysis and test impact assessment
- **@task-decomposer**: Structure findings into actionable tasks with test considerations

### Implementation Subagents (called via `commands.sh`)
Generated commands follow test-first approach:
1. **Test Impact Analysis**: @test-automation-engineer analyzes which tests will be affected
2. **Test Updates**: Update/create tests before implementation begins
3. **Guided Implementation**: Other subagents implement changes with test safety guards
4. **Validation**: Automated test runs with failure handling
5. **Documentation**: @project-scribe documents successful optimizations only

**Test-First Command Pattern:**
```bash
@test-automation-engineer analyze-test-impact --issues='#1,#3'
@test-automation-engineer update-tests --test-plan='analysis.md'
@code-reviewer fix issue-#1 --test-guided --preserve-tests
pytest -xvs || exit 1
@project-scribe document optimization-session
```

## Workflow Examples

### Standard Feature Development Cycle with Test-First Optimization
```bash
# After completing a feature
git add . && git commit -m "feat: user authentication system"

# Run optimization analysis (includes test impact analysis)
/optimize
# → Creates issues.json with 10 findings including test impact

# Review and make decisions with test-first mindset
/optimize-review
# User input: "Implement #1, #3, #8, Skip #2, Defer #4, #5, #6, #7, #9, #10"
# → Generates commands.sh with test-first workflow

# Execute test-driven improvements
bash .claude/optimize/pending/commands.sh
# → 1. Analyzes test impact
# → 2. Updates tests before refactoring  
# → 3. Implements changes with test safety
# → 4. Validates with pytest
# → 5. Documents only successful changes

# Commit improvements (only if tests pass)
/commit-changes

# Check system status
/optimize-status
```

### Emergency Security Review
```bash
# Quick security audit
/optimize
# Focus on security findings

/optimize-review  
# Prioritize all CRITICAL and HIGH security issues
# "Implement #3, #5, #7 --comment='Security priority'"

bash .claude/optimize/pending/commands.sh
# Immediate implementation of security fixes
```

## Issue Categories and Priorities

### Categories
- **REFACTORING**: Code quality, performance, maintainability
- **ARCHITECTURE**: System design, patterns, API consistency  
- **TESTING**: Test coverage, quality assurance
- **SECURITY**: Vulnerabilities, best practices, compliance

### Priority Levels
- **CRITICAL**: Security vulnerabilities, system-breaking issues
- **HIGH**: Performance bottlenecks, architectural violations
- **MEDIUM**: Code quality improvements, missing tests
- **LOW**: Documentation, minor optimizations

## Advanced Features

### GitHub Integration
- **Issue Creation** - Structured GitHub issues with optimization context
- **Label Management** - Automatic labeling by priority and category
- **Backlog Migration** - Convert deferred items to project management issues
- **Tracking Integration** - Links optimization sessions to GitHub activity

### Decision Tracking
- **Historical Record** - Complete audit trail of all optimization decisions
- **Comment System** - Rich context for why decisions were made
- **Progress Metrics** - Quantitative tracking of optimization impact
- **Team Coordination** - Shareable reports for team alignment

### Safety Features
- **Isolated Structure** - No interference with existing Claude Code setup
- **Safe Cleanup** - `rm -rf .claude/optimize/` without affecting agents/commands
- **Test Validation** - Mandatory test passage before changes are documented
- **Rollback Support** - Easy recovery from problematic optimizations

## Advanced Usage

### Continuous Quality Gates
```bash
# Pre-commit hook integration
git add . && /optimize && /optimize-review && git commit
```

### Project Health Monitoring  
```bash
# Weekly quality review
/optimize-status
# Check backlog and trends

# Monthly cleanup
find .claude/optimize/ -name "*.md" -mtime +30 -delete
```

### Custom Issue Tracking
```bash
# Convert deferred issues to GitHub issues (safe read-only operation)
if [ -f .claude/optimize/backlog/deferred_issues.json ]; then
  cat .claude/optimize/backlog/deferred_issues.json | jq '.[] | "Title: \(.title)\nBody: \(.description)"'
else
  echo "No deferred issues found"
fi
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Git Integration
- Run `/optimize` after major feature completion
- Include optimization commits in feature branches
- Use `/optimize-status` in CI/CD health checks

### Documentation Sync
- **@project-scribe** automatically updates:
  - `CHANGELOG.md` with optimization improvements
  - `docs/PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md` with architecture changes
  - `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` with technical updates
  - `src/*/CLAUDE.md` context files for AI agents

### Team Collaboration
- Share `.claude/optimize/reports/` for code review context
- Use `.claude/optimize/decisions/` for architectural decision records
- Archive `.claude/optimize/completed/` for project retrospectives

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No pending issues found"**
- Run `/optimize` first to generate analysis

**Commands fail with permission errors** 
- Ensure bash commands are allowed in your environment
- Check file permissions on `.claude/optimize/` directory

**Subagent commands not executing**
- Verify subagent availability in your environment
- Check command syntax in `.claude/optimize/pending/commands.sh`

### Maintenance

**Safe Cleanup - Optimization Data Only:**
```bash
# Only remove optimization-specific files, preserve agents/commands
rm -rf .claude/optimize/

# This safely removes all optimization data while preserving:
# - .claude/agents/ (your agents)  
# - .claude/commands/ (your commands)
# - Any other .claude/ contents

echo "✅ Optimization data cleared, agents and commands preserved"
```

**Archive Old Data:**
```bash
mkdir -p archive/$(date +%Y%m)
mv .claude/optimize/completed/implemented_*.json archive/$(date +%Y%m)/ 2>/dev/null
mv .claude/optimize/reports/optimization_*.md archive/$(date +%Y%m)/ 2>/dev/null
mv .claude/optimize/decisions/review_*.md archive/$(date +%Y%m)/ 2>/dev/null
echo "✅ Old optimization data archived"
```

**Backup Decisions:**
```bash
cp -r .claude/optimize/decisions/ backup/optimization-decisions-$(date +%Y%m%d)/
```

### Safe Operations Only
All maintenance operations are designed to preserve your existing `.claude/` agents, commands, and configurations. The isolated `.claude/optimize/` structure ensures safe cleanup with `rm -rf .claude/optimize/` without affecting other files.

## Performance Expectations

- **Analysis Phase**: 30-60 seconds depending on codebase size
- **Review Phase**: Interactive, depends on user decision time
- **Implementation**: Varies by issue complexity and subagent response time
- **Documentation**: Automatic, 10-30 seconds for changelog updates

This system scales with your codebase and provides consistent quality assurance throughout your development lifecycle.
